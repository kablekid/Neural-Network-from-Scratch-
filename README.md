# Neural-Network-from-Scratch-
I am currently learning machine learning, with a focus on building neural networks from scratch. I've decided to document everything I learn along the way, creating a resource I can refer to later. This documentation may also serve as a guide for others, allowing them to adapt the information to suit their own needs.
